    <h1>Careers with Cats</h1>
    <p>
        Careers with cats: Most jobs working with cats involve working in catteries including at private boarding, quarantine and animal rescue charity catteries.
        Other jobs include cat sitting (small businesses), cat grooming and cat behaviour roles.
        For many jobs with cats, it is crucial to have relevant training as without this, your CV wonâ€™t get noticed.
